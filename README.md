## All the Essential Image Manipulation Operations in One Place

### Why use this?

Most image manipulation tasks are handled on slow, ad-ridden websites with watermarks, and limited features locked behind premium paywalls. This project provides a solution for performing these operations offline and efficiently, with no restrictions. It is built for those who want a fast, watermark-free experience for cleaning up images for projects, presentations, or any other design-related task.

## Features

### Currently Implemented:

- **Background Remover**  
  Remove backgrounds from images effortlessly.
  
- **Image Compressor**  
  Compress images by reducing their resolution while maintaining quality and essential contents.
  
- **Noise Reducer**  
  Reduce image noise to create a cleaner, more professional look.
  
- **File Format Converter**  
  Convert an image file to any format you need (PNG, JPEG, etc.).
